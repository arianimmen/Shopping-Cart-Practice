# 🛒 Shopping Cart Practice

Welcome to my **Shopping Cart Practice** project! This website was created as a practice exercise to enhance my JavaScript skills, with a particular focus on developing a dynamic shopping cart feature.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to build a functional shopping cart where users can:

- **Add items to the cart**
- **Increase or decrease item quantities**
- **Remove items from the cart**

All user interactions with the cart are stored in **local storage**, ensuring that selections are remembered even after the page is refreshed.

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 📸 Design Inspiration

The design of this site was inspired by a Nike UI design on Figma. Approximately 60% of the design elements were inspired by this [Figma Community Design](https://www.figma.com/design/bLAw051QTqDLuAFgRmcOKJ/Nike-UI-Inspiration--Free-UI-(Recreated)-(Community)-(Community)?node-id=28-230&t=XTI4lUhUzDsY5DWn-00). The remaining elements were customized to suit the specific needs of this project.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core functionality, especially for managing the shopping cart and local storage.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Structure and styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the site is fully responsive across all devices.
